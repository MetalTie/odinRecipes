    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><!-- First Step (Preparing Chicken) -->
            Rinse chicken wings and pat dry with paper towels. Place onto a baking sheet, 
            cover, and refrigerate until sauce is finished.
        </li>
        <li><!-- Second Step (Preparing Sauce) -->
            Pur&#233;e mango nectar, brown sugar, habanero peppers, soy sauce, Sriracha, and 
            vinegar in a food processor. Remove the food processor lid carefully as the 
            pepper fumes can be strong.

                    You can use any <a href="https://slowlivingkitchen.com/food-processor-substitutes/" target="_blank">alternative</a> if you 
                    don't have a food processor.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li><!-- Third Step (Making the Sauce) -->
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 
            about 30 seconds. Immediately add mango-habanero mixture and bring to a simmer, 
            stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in honey. Simmer, 
            stirring frequently, until sauce is reduced by 75% and thickened to a glaze, 
            45 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li><!-- Fourth Step (Preparing Oil for the Chicken) -->
            While the sauce is cooking, place a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat 
            to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F 
            (175 degrees C). Place cornstarch in a resealable plastic bag.
        </li>
        <li><!-- Fifth Step (Staging the Chicken to be Cooked) -->
            Remove wings from the refrigerator and toss in small batches in cornstarch to 
            lightly coat. Place in a single layer onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li><!-- Sixth Step (Fry the Chicken then bake them) -->
            Fry 5 to 6 wings at a time in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. 
            Drain on paper towels, then place on the baking sheet in the preheated oven to keep 
            warm while you fry remaining batches.
        </li>
        <li><!-- Seventh Step (Sauce the chicken!) -->
            Remove wings from the oven and place into a large bowl. Pour 1/2 of the hot sauce 
            over top and mix to coat. Continue adding sauce until wings are coated to your liking.
